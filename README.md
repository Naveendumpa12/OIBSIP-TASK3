# OIBSIP-TASK3
I have Successfully Completed Task-3 of the Java Programming Internship at Oasis Infobyte, which is "ATM Interface".


This complex project is a "console-based application" that allows users to perform the following operations:
1. Check Transactions History
2. Withdraw
3. Deposit
4. Transfer
5. Exit

Here's a detailed description of my project :

1. It welcomes the user and asks for their account number and PIN Number

2. It checks either the login credentials are correct or Not.

3. If the login credentials are correct,User will be Login successful, it presents a menu with options like checking transaction history, withdrawing money, transferring funds, depositing money, or quitting.

4. Based on the user's choice, it performs the corresponding action:

 - If the user chooses transaction history, it shows the account balance and recent transactions.
 - If the user chooses to withdraw money, it asks for the amount and update the transaction history accordingly.
 - If the user chooses to transfer funds, it asks for the beneficiary's account number and the amount to transfer and updates the transaction history.
 - If the user chooses to deposit money, it asks for the amount and updates the transaction history.
 - If the user chooses to quit, it ends the program.
